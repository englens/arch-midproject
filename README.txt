To build, the boost library must be directly in the project folder: "arch-midproject/boost_1_76_0/"
The runnable projects are "MainExe" and "BatchMode".

Every project is currently in German locale mode. This can be changed in each projects .cpp file, by uncommenting. 
The locale files are all located in "locale/".
